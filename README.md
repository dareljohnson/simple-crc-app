This is a simple editor to create Class Responsibility Collaborators cards.
I have built it to learn Angular 4.0, because that's the best way for me to learn new stuff.
I didn't want to use a full CSS framework like Bootstrap which has a lot of premade components.
I extracted some styles from Bulma.io and customized them my way.
Things are not yet perfect but useable.
The application is not (yet) responsive.
Some features I would like to add:
- A pdf export with jsPdf
- An SVG export.
- Maybe an auto-layouting feature.

Shouldn't be to difficult to implement,
these features are really just a couple of lines of code away.
The code base is small, so if you would like 
to implement those features, I can help.


Here is a [demo](https://guidolx.github.io/simple-crc-app/)
